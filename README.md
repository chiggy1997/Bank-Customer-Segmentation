# Bank-Customer-Segmentation
Bank Customer Segmentation with kmeans, PCA and Encoder decoder.

## 1. Overview:					
#### a. Goal
 	* It's crucial for marketers to know customer and their needs				
	* To design targeted marketing campaign tailored for specific needs.				
	* For that they need to perform accurate customer segmentation.				
					

#### a. Challenges Faced	
	* Collection of data from twitter through twitter API				
	* Structuring and making sense of unstructured and noisy text data.				
	* Data cleaning and preprocessing.				
					
#### a. Interesting findings					
					
					
					
					
					
					
## 2. Code and resource used:	
  	* Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib.py				
					
## 3. About the data:
	* 6 month extensive customer data of a New York Bank.				
					
					
## 4. Data Preprocessing:	
  	* Filling missing values with mean imputation.				
	* Removing duplicates				
	* Remove irrelevant columns				
					
## 5. Visualisation:
 	* Heatmap of correlation betwnn the features				
	* Plotting dist plot for all features to find their distribution				
	* PCA with 2 principal components.				
					
## 6. Modelling:
 	* Standardizing the data to perform Kmeans				
	* Finding optimal number of clusters with Elbow method				
	* Applying Kmeans with the optimal k value.				
	* Applied PCA with 2 principal components to visulaize the results.Seabornscatterplot was used to perform this.				
	* Apllied autoencoders for dimensionality reduction from 18 features to 10 features.
